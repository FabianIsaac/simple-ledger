# Simple Ledger

Personal finance tracking inside [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), inspired by [ledger-cli](https://ledger-cli.org/). Track your income, expenses, transfers, and debts using double-entry bookkeeping — all stored as plain text inside your vault.

---

## Features

- **Double-entry bookkeeping** — every transaction is always balanced
- **Multiple views** — sidebar summary, full dashboard, quick-add panel, and recurring payments panel
- **Account hierarchy** — organize accounts with unlimited nesting (e.g. `Gastos:Comida:Restaurantes`)
- **Recurring transactions** — schedule weekly, monthly, or yearly payments and track which ones are paid
- **Credit / debt management** — calculate interest, monthly installments, and track payoff progress
- **Transaction notes** — attach a note to any transaction for extra context
- **Import transactions** — paste ledger-formatted text and preview before saving; includes an AI prompt helper to generate entries from bank emails
- **Export to CSV** — download a filtered or full transaction list as a spreadsheet
- **Inline account management** — add, rename, delete, and configure accounts directly in the dashboard without leaving the view
- **Excluded-from-balance accounts** — mark accounts like pension/AFP funds so they are tracked but not counted in your liquid balance cards
- **Semantic account coloring** — expenses, income, and liabilities each have a distinct color in the account tree and transaction list
- **Monthly summary** — sidebar shows current-month income, expenses, and net at a glance
- **Quick-filter commands** — keyboard shortcuts to instantly filter by current month, current year, expenses only, or income only
- **Markdown code blocks** — embed live balance tables, transaction registers, and summaries in any note
- **Plain-text storage** — your data lives in a `.ledger` file compatible with ledger-cli
- **Customizable currency** — symbol, position, and decimal places

## Installation

### From the Obsidian Community Plugins directory

1. Open Obsidian → **Settings** → **Community plugins**
2. Make sure **Restricted mode** is off
3. Click **Browse** and search for **Simple Ledger**
4. Click **Install** and then **Enable**

### Manual installation

1. Download `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/FabianIsaac/simple-ledger/releases)
2. Create a folder at `<your vault>/.obsidian/plugins/simple-ledger/`
3. Copy the three files into that folder
4. Go to **Settings** → **Community plugins** and enable **Simple Ledger**

---

## Getting Started

1. Open the sidebar by clicking the **wallet icon** in the left ribbon, or run `Ctrl+P` → **Simple Ledger: Abrir panel lateral**
2. Click **+ Nuevo** to add your first transaction
3. That's it — your data is saved automatically in a `.ledger` file inside your vault

---

## The Sidebar Panel

The main sidebar gives you a real-time overview of your finances:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Summary cards** | Total income, total expenses, and net balance (accounts excluded from balance are not counted) |
| **Monthly summary** | Current-month income, expenses, and net in a second row of cards |
| **Accounts** | Hierarchical tree showing the balance of each account, color-coded by type |
| **Transactions** | Paginated list of recent transactions — click any row to edit it |

### Sidebar buttons

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **+ Nuevo** | Open the add-transaction form |
| **↻** | Reload data from the ledger file |
| **⚙** (next to Accounts) | Open the account manager modal |

---

## Adding Transactions

Click **+ Nuevo** (or run the command **Nueva transaccion**) to open the transaction form:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fecha** | Transaction date (defaults to today) |
| **Descripcion** | Name or description (e.g. "Grocery store", "March salary") |
| **Monto** | Amount in your currency |
| **Tipo** | Type: Expense, Income, or Transfer |
| **Destino** | Account receiving the money |
| **Origen** | Account the money comes from |
| **Estado** | Status: Confirmed (`*`), Pending (`!`), or Unmarked |
| **Notas** | Optional free-text note attached to the transaction |

### Transaction types

- **Expense** — money leaves an asset account and enters an expense account
  - Example: Grocery shopping → `Expenses:Food` ← `Assets:Bank`
- **Income** — money enters an asset account from an income account
  - Example: Receiving salary → `Assets:Bank` ← `Income:Salary`
- **Transfer** — money moves between two asset accounts
  - Example: Withdrawing cash → `Assets:Cash` ← `Assets:Bank`

---

## Editing and Deleting Transactions

Click on any transaction row in the sidebar or dashboard to open the edit form (a pencil icon ✎ appears on hover).

From the editor you can:
- Modify any field (date, description, amount, accounts, status, notes)
- **Save** — updates the transaction in the ledger file
- **Delete** — removes the transaction (with a confirmation dialog)

---

## Dashboard (Main Panel)

Open the full dashboard with `Ctrl+P` → **Abrir panel central** or via the bar-chart icon in the ribbon.

The dashboard includes:
- **Filters** — date range, account, free-text search
- **Quick filter buttons** — Today / This Month / This Year / All
- **Cash flow chart** — visual income vs. expenses over time
- **Transaction list** — mobile-friendly card layout showing date, payee, accounts, and amount; click any row to edit
- **Account panel** — balance breakdown per account with semantic coloring; click ⚙ to open the inline account manager
- **Action buttons** — **+ Nueva** (add transaction), **⬆ Importar** (import from text), **⬇ CSV** (export), **↻** (reload)

### Inline account manager

Clicking ⚙ in the account panel opens a management panel directly in the dashboard without navigating away:

- **Tabs** — switch between Gastos, Ingresos, Activos, and Pasivos
- **Sorted list** — accounts displayed alphabetically
- **Add** — type a name, select prefix, press **+** (prefix is pre-filled based on the active tab)
- **Rename** — click ✎ to edit inline, press Enter to save; all existing transactions are updated automatically
- **Delete** — click × to remove an account
- **Exclude from balance** — click ◎ to exclude an account from the summary balance cards (shown with ⊘ when excluded); useful for accounts whose funds are not freely accessible (e.g. pension/AFP)

### Importing transactions

Click **⬆ Importar** to open the import dialog:

1. Paste one or more transactions in ledger-cli format into the text area
2. The preview updates live — valid transactions are listed with date, payee, and amount
3. Click **📋 Copiar cuentas para IA** to copy all your accounts and format instructions to the clipboard, so you can paste them into ChatGPT or Claude to generate entries from a bank email or statement
4. Click **Importar** to save all previewed transactions to your ledger file

### Exporting to CSV

Click **⬇ CSV** to download the currently filtered transactions as a comma-separated file. If no filter is active, all transactions are exported.

### Quick-filter commands

The following commands are available from the command palette (`Ctrl+P`) and can be assigned keyboard shortcuts:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Filtrar: mes actual** | Show transactions from the current calendar month |
| **Filtrar: año actual** | Show transactions from the current calendar year |
| **Filtrar: solo gastos** | Show only expense accounts |
| **Filtrar: solo ingresos** | Show only income accounts |
| **Limpiar filtros** | Reset all active filters |

---

## Quick Add Panel

For fast data entry, open the Quick Add panel with `Ctrl+P` → **Agregar movimientos**.

- Select transaction type (Expense / Income / Transfer / Debt) with one click
- Fill in date, description, amount, and accounts
- **Recent items** shown below for quick repeating of common transactions

---

## Account Management

Accounts can be managed in two ways:
- **Inline panel** — click ⚙ in the dashboard account section for an embedded manager
- **Modal** — run `Ctrl+P` → **Gestionar cuentas** for a standalone window

Both offer the same functionality.

### Account types

| Type | Prefix | Purpose | Color |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Gastos (Expenses)** | `Gastos:` | Where money goes | Red |
| **Ingresos (Income)** | `Ingresos:` | Where money comes from | Green |
| **Activos (Assets)** | `Activos:` | Things you own | Neutral |
| **Pasivos (Liabilities)** | `Pasivos:` | What you owe | Yellow/Orange |

### Actions

- **Add account** — type a name, select the prefix, and press **+**
- **Rename account** — click ✎, edit inline, press Enter. All existing transactions are updated automatically.
- **Delete account** — click × to remove an account
- **Exclude from balance** — click ◎ to toggle exclusion. Excluded accounts (shown as ⊘) are still tracked and visible in the tree, but their balance is not counted in the summary cards. This is useful for accounts like pension funds (AFP) whose money is not freely accessible.

> **Note:** Excluding an account from balance only affects the summary cards. The account still appears in the tree, and all its transactions remain in the ledger.

### Sub-accounts

Use `:` to create hierarchies. You can nest as many levels as you need:

```
Gastos:Comida
Gastos:Comida:Restaurantes
Gastos:Comida:Supermercado
Activos:Banco:BBVA
Activos:Banco:Santander
```

The sidebar shows the aggregated balance at each parent level.

### Using credit card accounts

Liability accounts like `Pasivos:TarjetaCredito` require two specific transaction types that are available in both the transaction form and the Quick Add panel:

| Type | Destination | Source | When to use |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Cargo tarjeta** | `Gastos:*` | `Pasivos:TarjetaCredito` | Buying something with the card |
| **Pago tarjeta** | `Pasivos:TarjetaCredito` | `Activos:Banco` | Paying the card balance |

Example flow:
1. You buy groceries with your credit card → **Cargo tarjeta**, amount `$85,000`, to `Gastos:Comida`, from `Pasivos:TarjetaCredito`
2. At the end of the month you pay the card → **Pago tarjeta**, amount `$85,000`, to `Pasivos:TarjetaCredito`, from `Activos:Banco`

The `Pasivos:TarjetaCredito` account will show a **negative** balance — this is correct in double-entry bookkeeping. The absolute value is what you owe.

---

## Recurring Transactions

Open the recurring panel with `Ctrl+P` → **Abrir panel de recurrentes** or via the repeat icon in the ribbon.

### Creating a recurring transaction

1. Click **+ Nueva** in the recurring panel
2. Fill in: name, amount, source/destination accounts, frequency, and day of the month/week
3. Save — the transaction is tracked and its next due date is calculated automatically

### Frequency options

| Frequency | Configuration |
|-----------|--------------|
| Monthly | Day of the month (1–31) |
| Weekly | Day of the week (Monday–Sunday) |
| Yearly | Month and day of the year |

### Panel tabs

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| **All** | Every recurring transaction |
| **Pending** | Due but not yet paid this period |
| **Paid** | Already paid this period |
| **Credits** | Linked loan/credit payments |

### Summary cards

The recurring panel header shows:
- Number of pending payments
- Number of paid payments
- Total monthly commitment

---

## Credit / Debt Management

Open the credit wizard with `Ctrl+P` → **Nuevo credito**.

### Setting up a credit/loan

1. Enter the loan **name** (will become a `Pasivos:` account)
2. Enter the **principal** (amount received) and **total debt** (principal + all interest and fees)
3. Enter the **number of months** for repayment
4. Select the **asset account** payments will come from and the **payment day**
5. The wizard automatically calculates:
   - Monthly payment amount
   - Total interest / fee portion
   - Per-payment principal vs. interest split

### What gets created

- A `Pasivos:<name>` liability account
- A recurring monthly payment linked to that account
- An interest sub-account (`Gastos:Intereses:<name>`) if there is a difference between principal and total debt
- A ledger transaction recording the initial deposit to your bank

### Tracking payoff

Each time you mark a credit payment as paid, the plugin registers two postings:
- Reduction of the liability account (principal portion)
- Expense entry for the interest portion

This keeps your balance sheet accurate throughout the loan term.

---

## Markdown Code Blocks

Embed live financial reports in any Obsidian note using special code blocks. The reports update automatically whenever your ledger file changes.

### Balance

Shows the balance of each account:

````
```ledger-balance
```
````

### Register

Shows a detailed list of transactions:

````
```ledger-register
```
````

### Summary

Shows income, expenses, and net grouped by period:

````
```ledger-summary
```
````

---

### Filter options

All three block types accept filter options, one per line, in `key: value` format:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `cuenta` | Filter by account name (partial match) | `cuenta: Gastos` |
| `desde` | Start date (inclusive) | `desde: 2026/03/01` |
| `hasta` | End date (inclusive) | `hasta: 2026/03/31` |
| `mes` | Shortcut for a full calendar month | `mes: 2026/03` |
| `año` | Shortcut for a full calendar year | `año: 2026` |
| `hoy` | Shortcut for today only | `hoy` |
| `buscar` | Search in description or account name | `buscar: supermercado` |
| `limite` | Maximum number of results | `limite: 5` |
| `orden` | Sort order: `asc` or `desc` (default: `desc`) | `orden: asc` |
| `periodo` | For summary only: `mes` (monthly) or `anual` (yearly) | `periodo: anual` |

### Practical examples

**Expenses for March 2026:**
````
```ledger-balance
mes: 2026/03
cuenta: Gastos
```
````

**Last 5 food transactions:**
````
```ledger-register
cuenta: Comida
limite: 5
```
````

**Yearly summary:**
````
```ledger-summary
año: 2026
periodo: anual
```
````

**Today's transactions:**

```ledger-register
hoy
```
````

**Search by keyword:**
````
```ledger-register
buscar: supermercado
orden: asc
```
````

## Understanding Double-Entry Bookkeeping

Every transaction in Simple Ledger has at least two postings that cancel each other out. This guarantees your books are always balanced.

### Why is the total balance always $0?

Because that is correct. Every peso (or dollar, or euro) that enters one account must leave another:

```
Activos:Banco        +$1,000,000   (your bank balance goes up)
Ingresos:Salario     -$1,000,000   (the source is recorded)
Total = $0
```

If the total is NOT zero, there is an error in a transaction.

### How each type works internally

| Type | Debit (receives) | Credit (gives) |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Expense | Expense account | Asset account |
| Income | Asset account | Income account |
| Transfer | Destination asset | Source asset |

---

## The `.ledger` File Format

Your data is stored as a plain-text file compatible with [ledger-cli](https://ledger-cli.org/). You can open and edit it directly with `Ctrl+P` → **Abrir archivo ledger**, or with any text editor.

```ledger
; Comment
2026/03/01 * Salario Marzo
    ; Deposito quincena
    Activos:Banco              $1000000
    Ingresos:Salario

2026/03/02 * Supermercado
    Gastos:Comida              $85000
    Activos:Banco

2026/03/05 * Pago cuota credito
    Pasivos:CreditoBanco       $150000
    Activos:Banco
```

### Format rules

- The first line of each transaction is: `DATE [STATUS] DESCRIPTION`
- A line starting with `;` immediately after the date line is treated as a **note** for that transaction
- Subsequent lines (indented) are account postings
- The last posting can omit the amount — it is calculated automatically to balance the transaction
- Status flags: `*` = confirmed, `!` = pending, no flag = unmarked
- Comments begin with `;`
- Dates use `YYYY/MM/DD` format

---

## Example: Recording a Bank Loan

1. Add a `Pasivos:CreditoBancoChile` account in the account manager (or use the credit wizard)
2. When you receive the loan (bank deposits the money):
   - Type: Transfer
   - Destination: `Activos:Banco`
   - Source: `Pasivos:CreditoBancoChile`
   - This records that your bank balance increases but so does your debt
3. When you pay a monthly installment:
   - Type: Transfer
   - Destination: `Pasivos:CreditoBancoChile`
   - Source: `Activos:Banco`
   - This records that your debt decreases along with your bank balance

Using the **credit wizard** automates steps 2 and 3 entirely.

---

## Obsidian URI Support

Simple Ledger supports [Obsidian URIs](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI) so you can register transactions from outside Obsidian — phone home screen buttons, browser bookmarks, scripts, or any other app that can open a URL.

### URI format

```
obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=VAULT_NAME&payee=DESCRIPTION&amount=AMOUNT&to=TO_ACCOUNT&from=FROM_ACCOUNT
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Example |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `vault` | Recommended | Your Obsidian vault name. Required if you have more than one vault. | `MisFinanzas` |
| `payee` | Yes | Transaction description | `Supermercado` |
| `amount` | Yes | Numeric amount — no currency symbol, no thousands separators | `85000` |
| `to` | Yes | Destination account (full name including prefix) | `Gastos:Comida` |
| `from` | Yes | Source account (full name including prefix) | `Activos:Banco` |
| `date` | No | Date in `YYYY/MM/DD` format. Defaults to today. | `2026/03/22` |
| `status` | No | `*` = confirmed, `!` = pending, omit = unmarked. Defaults to `*`. | `*` |

> **Finding your vault name:** In Obsidian, go to **Settings → About** and look at the vault name at the top, or check the folder name of your vault on disk. Spaces in the vault name must be encoded as `%20` (e.g. `vault=Mis%20Finanzas`).

### URL encoding

Account names use `:` as a separator (e.g. `Gastos:Comida`). Most tools handle this automatically, but if your environment requires strict encoding, replace `:` with `%3A` and spaces with `%20` or `+`.

| Character | Encoded |
|-----------|---------|
| `:` | `%3A` (or leave as-is in most tools) |
| space | `%20` or `+` |
| `/` in dates | `%2F` (or leave as-is in most tools) |

### Examples

**Grocery expense paid in cash:**
```
obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Supermercado&amount=85000&to=Gastos:Comida&from=Activos:Efectivo
```

**Charge something to a credit card:**
```
obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Netflix&amount=15000&to=Gastos:Entretenimiento&from=Pasivos:TarjetaCredito
```

**Pay the credit card:**
```
obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Pago+tarjeta&amount=150000&to=Pasivos:TarjetaCredito&from=Activos:Banco
```

**Record salary income on a specific date:**
```
obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Salario+Marzo&amount=1000000&to=Activos:Banco&from=Ingresos:Salario&date=2026/03/31
```

**Mark a transaction as pending:**
```
obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Arriendo&amount=400000&to=Gastos:Hogar&from=Activos:Banco&status=!
```

If any required parameter (`payee`, `amount`, `to`, `from`) is missing, the plugin opens the transaction form so you can fill in the rest manually.

### Setting up iOS Shortcuts

iOS Shortcuts lets you create home screen buttons that record a transaction in one tap — ideal for coffee, transport, or any daily expense.

**Create a simple one-tap expense button:**

1. Open the **Shortcuts** app → tap **+** to create a new shortcut
2. Tap **Add action** → search for **"Open URLs"** and select it
3. Paste your URI in the URL field:
   ```
   obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Cafe&amount=3000&to=Gastos:Comida&from=Activos:Efectivo
   ```
4. Tap the shortcut name at the top to rename it (e.g. "☕ Café")
5. Tap **Done**
6. Long-press the shortcut → **Add to Home Screen**

Now tapping that icon on your home screen registers the transaction immediately and opens Obsidian to confirm it.

**Create a shortcut that asks for the amount each time:**

1. Create a new shortcut
2. Add action **"Ask for Input"** → set type to **Number**, prompt to `Monto`
3. Add action **"Open URLs"**
4. In the URL field, tap where you want the amount and insert the **"Provided Input"** variable from the action list:
   ```
   obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Gasto&amount=[Provided Input]&to=Gastos:Otros&from=Activos:Banco
   ```
5. Name it and add it to the Home Screen

This way the shortcut asks you for the amount before opening Obsidian.

---

### Setting up Android Shortcuts

**Using the HTTP Shortcuts app (recommended):**

1. Install [HTTP Shortcuts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rmy.android.http_shortcuts) from the Play Store
2. Tap **+** → **Browser Shortcut**
3. Set the URL to your URI:
   ```
   obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Supermercado&amount=85000&to=Gastos:Comida&from=Activos:Banco
   ```
4. Give it a name and icon
5. Long-press the shortcut in the app → **Place on Home Screen**

**Using Tasker:**

1. Create a new **Task**
2. Add action **Misc → Browse URL**
3. Set the URL to your `obsidian://simple-ledger?...` URI
4. Create a **Task Shortcut** widget on the home screen pointing to that task

---

### Browser bookmark (desktop)

On desktop you can save URIs as browser bookmarks for quick logging from your browser.

1. In your browser, create a new bookmark
2. Set the **URL** to:
   ```
   obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Almuerzo&amount=12000&to=Gastos:Comida&from=Activos:Banco
   ```
3. Give it a name and place it in your bookmarks bar

Clicking it will switch to Obsidian and register the transaction.

---

### Scripting and automation

You can call the URI from any script. The exact method depends on your operating system:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
open "obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Suscripcion&amount=9900&to=Gastos:Entretenimiento&from=Activos:Banco"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Start-Process "obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault&payee=Suscripcion&amount=9900&to=Gastos:Entretenimiento&from=Activos:Banco"
```

**Windows (CMD):**
```cmd
start obsidian://simple-ledger?vault=MyVault^&payee=Suscripcion^&amount=9900^&to=Gastos:Entretenimiento^&from=Activos:Banco
```
> Note: In CMD, escape `&` with `^`.

This makes it easy to trigger ledger entries from cron jobs, calendar reminders, or other automations.
